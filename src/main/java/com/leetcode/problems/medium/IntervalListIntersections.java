/**
 * Given two lists of closed intervals, each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.
 *
 * Return the intersection of these two interval lists.
 *
 * (Formally, a closed interval [a, b] (with a <= b) denotes the set of real numbers x with a <= x <= b.  The intersection of two
 * closed intervals is a set of real numbers that is either empty, or can be represented as a closed interval.  For example, the
 * intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].)
